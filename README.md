# MintGPT

Image generation web application making use of Open AI Api to generate images based on user generated prompts that can be minted later as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) by the use of Tezos blockchain 

# Features

1. AI Image generating: Based on user input, the program employs OpenAI's robust image generating capabilities to produce distinctive and varied images. The interaction of artificial intelligence and human creativity produces the generated visuals.

2. User Prompt Submission: Users can give prompts or keywords to direct the AI in producing the desired image. Users are free to exercise their imaginations by responding to the questions, which might range from short sentences to more in-depth explanations.

3. Tezos Blockchain Integration: Users have the option to mint the generated image as an NFT utilizing the Tezos blockchain after the image generation procedure. Users are able to securely own and trade their one-of-a-kind inventions thanks to this integration, which guarantees the immutability and authenticity of the generated NFTs.

4. Metadata and Ownership proof: The application automatically associates metadata, such as the prompt used for generation, a timestamp, and ownership information, with each generated NFT. The Tezos blockchain stores this metadata, giving each NFT transparency and ownership evidence.
